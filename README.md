# NFL Tackles: Big Data Bowl 2024 🏈

This repository contains my analysis of NFL tackle data for provided in the Big Data Bowl 2024.

The goal of this project was to develop and apply skills in BigQuery, dbtCloud, and Tableau. Since Tableau Public does not support a direct connection to BigQuery, I opted to create an Excel version of the data table as a workaround, rather than purchasing a Tableau license.

Tableau Dashboard: [Link here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/connor.thornhill/viz/NFL_bdb_2024_tackles/NFLTackles2023?publish=yes) 

SQL Table Logic: [Link here](https://github.com/connorthornhill9/nfl_bdb_2024_tackles/blob/main/models/player_tackles_pbp_2024.sql)

The goal of the dashboard is to provide simple but insightful charts to breakdown player tackle data. For example, Jordyn Brooks has the most solo tackles out of any player, however, Foyesade Oluokun has more tackle assists. 

We can also see that Jordyn Brooks has more missed tackles duiring the last 2 quarters of the game whereas Zaire Franklin seems to perform better in the last half of the game with less missed tackles.
## Jordyn Brooks 🏃‍♂️

## Zaire Franklin 🏃‍♂️

## Conclusion

I forsee this as a self service dashboard where I could further work on the design and charts with stakeholders. For now, I was happy with the result to integrate DBT, BigQuery and Tableau to create a fairly useful product.
