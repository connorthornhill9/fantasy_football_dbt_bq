# NFL Tackles: Big Data Bowl 2024

This repository contains the files I created to analyze the tackle data provided in the NFL's Big Data Bowl 2024.

The goal of this project was to develop and apply skills in BigQuery, dbtCloud, and Tableau. Since Tableau Public does not support a direct connection to BigQuery, I opted to create an Excel version of the data table as a workaround, rather than purchasing a Tableau license.
